Our team wants to make simple console game operated by inputing message or number composed of character or some item.

## Class 

One of the mission was we should make 4 classes at least and also use inheritance necessarily. So our team made 5 classes named by 

Billion, Character,Labor, Stock, Game 

1.[Billion](###1.Billion)

2.[Character](#2.Character)

3.[Labor](####3.Labor)

4.[Stock](####4.Stock)

5.[Game](####5.Game)

### 1.Billion
This class is real execution code of this game

So if you want play the game, you should save all class source file in same directory, and compile this class

When I write this class, I realized the importance of while(true) infinite loop syntax
So I'll introduce loop syntax in Billion class
